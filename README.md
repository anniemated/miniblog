this is a small blogging site i made for my first time using ruby on rails! add text and images to sticky notes and make a nice bulletin board :D 
<br><br>

i made this for hack club's [railway](https://railway.hackclub.com/) ysws! this was really fun and i learned a lot abt databases, scaffolding, and rails in general. i definitely hope to do more with rails in the future!
